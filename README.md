# StashBusters: An Android Application for Crafters

StashBusters is a social, collaborative, and eco-conscious app where users share photos of their craft supply stashes – fabric, yarn, beads, paper, etc. – and swap supplies and ideas for using them, boosting creativity and keeping craft materials out of landfills.

**Target Users**
- Crafters, ages 18-35.
- Crafters that have too many craft materials lying around and/or crafters that want to inspire other crafters to creatively use craft materials they have lying around.
- Eco-conscious individuals that believe we should try to use what we already have instead of going out to buy new supplies.
- Any kind of crafter -- knitters, crocheters, sewists, jewelry-maker, woodworking, upcycler, thrift-flipper etc.

**Features**
- A personalized feed displaying posts from other users, with optinos to filter for posts from your friends or involving your favorite craft materials

- Notifications about your friends' activities and activity on your posts to keep users engaged and connected
- Profile pages for each user displaying their post history
- A space for storing a user's "liked" posts to view again later
